# Objective

The objective of this repository is to provide several simple implementation examples of applications, which will be integrated as an extension to [IBM Cloud Watson Assistant service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant#about). You can also visit the [Assistant-Toolkit](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/extensions#getting-started) to get started with the development and usage of custom extensions.

Each application needs to have an [Open API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (both 2.0 and 3.0 are supported).

This repository contains the source code and the steps how to do the setup and use the extension in the [IBM Cloud Watson Assistant service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant#about).
